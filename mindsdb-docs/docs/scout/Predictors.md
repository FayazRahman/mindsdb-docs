# Predictors

The Predictor, in MindsDBâ€™s words, means the machine learning model. In this dashboard, you will train the models from the Datasources. 

#### How to train Predictor?

MindsDB Scout offers two options for Predictor training:

* Upload the already existing model.
* Train a new one.

## Advanced Mode

Inside the Advanced Mode, you can specify additional options before training new Predictor as:

* `Sample Margin of Error`: the amount of random sampling error.
* `Stop Training After`: stop the model training after `n ` minutes.
* `Use GPU`: use Graphics Processing Unit for training.
* `Select columns to be removed for training`: speed the training or improve accuracy by ignoring un relevant columns.

## Predictor Results

The Predictor Results dashboard, provides powerful insights related to the model. The 3 important questions that this section answers are:

* How accurate is the model?
* What is relevant for this model?
* When can you trust this model?
