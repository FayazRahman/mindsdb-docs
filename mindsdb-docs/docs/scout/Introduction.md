# Introduction to MindsDB Scout

MindsDB Scout is a graphical user interface that sits on top of MindsDB and MindsDB Server. It lets you upload, analyze and visualize your data, train machine learning models and query them with few clicks directly from the Databases, your local file system or external resources.


## Start Scout

You don't need to install anything to run Scout. Starting the MindsDB server will automatically run Scout on your default browser. To do start mindsdb:

```
 python3 -m mindsdb
```

When MindsDB server is started it will display the URL for accessing Scout:

```
GUI should be available by http://localhost:47334/index.html
```

And automatically start Scout on that URL.
