# Install with Docker

You can run MindsDB in a docker container assuming that you have <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install" target="_blank">docker</a> installed on your machine. To make sure Docker is successfully installed on your machine, run:

```
docker run hello-world
```

You should see the `Hello from Docker!` message displayed. If not, check the <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started" target="_blank">get started</a> documentation.


### Run MindsDB container

MindsDB images are uploaded to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/mindsdb" target="_blank">MindsDB repo on docker hub</a> after each release.

#### Pull image

```
docker pull mindsdb/mindsdb

Or, to try out the latest beta version, pull the beta image:

```
docker run -p 47334:47334 mindsdb/mindsdb
```

That's it. MindsDB should automatically start the Studio on your default browser.

!!! info "Publish ports"
    Note that you must publish a containerâ€™s port to the host `-p 47334:47334`, which is used by the MindsDB GUI and HTTP API. Also, to use MindsDB MySQL API or MongoDB API, publish `-p 47335:47335 -p 47336:47336` ports too.
